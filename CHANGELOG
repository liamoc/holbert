* In progress
- Forward reasoning, calc proofs

* Version 0.6:
- New feature: Files can now be loaded directly from the local file system.
- Improvement: When supported, the download/save button produces a file picker dialog.
- Improvement: Can set associativity and precedence of mix-fix input syntax.
- Improvement: Notation blocks can now define more than one mix-fix syntax.
- Improvement: Proof style buttons condensed into hover-menu.
- New feature: Summary proof display style (breaks file format)
- New feature: Constructors. Identifiers that begin with '@' are assumed to be constructors, 
               which are rendered specially, and are automatically considered to be injective
               and disjoint from all other constructors. Injectivity and Disjointness are
               automatically used when eliminating on an equality assumption where both
               sides are constructors.
- Bug fix: Elimination rules that only refer to outer skolem variables no longer cause a crash.

* Version 0.5.1
- New feature: Tooltip footnotes for references and footnotes.
- New feature: Links are supported in paragraphs as are images by URL.
- New feature: Goal tag markup
- New feature: Overline syntax from * postfix.
- New feature: Embedding rules in text
- New feature: Embedding rule names in text
- New feature: "Reader mode" that hides buttons.
- New feature: "Presentation mode" that shows one section at a time.
- Improvement: Auto-rename introduced metas to avoid shadowing.
- New feature: Basic mix-fix syntax notation support.

* Version 0.5
- Improvement: Reflexivity now auto-applied by clicking the rewrite button
- New feature: Can now define multiple rules in an Axiom block
- New feature: Can now define "inductive definitions" as a block of
  introduction rules. Cases and induction rules are then auto-generated.
- Improvement: Can rewrite with local assumptions
- Improvement: Unification now gives better solutions for induction rules.
- Improvement: Axiom blocks can now contain multiple rules.

* Version 0.4
- New feature: Goal display on RHS
- Improvement: Only displays applicable rules
- New feature: Night mode
- New feature: Prose style proofs
- New feature: Apply a rule as an elimination rule
- New feature: Apply an equality rule as a rewrite
- Improvement: Holbert documents are now printable

* Version 0.3.1
- Improvement: Banished `String` representations to improve performance 
- Improvement: UI Performance greatly improved by not updating model on every keystroke.

* Version 0.3
- New feature: Can now instantiate metavariables in proofs
- Improvement: Metavariables are represented numerically for efficiency.
- Bug fix: Incorrect version number in HTML title 

* Version 0.2
- New feature: Tooltips are now on all icons
- New feature: Can now download documents as a JSON blob
- New feature: Can now load documents from a JSON blob via XHR
- Change: Now loads index.holbert on startup
- Bug fix: Does not display trash can on the base conclusion of a rule.
- Bug fix: Fixed font sizes for heading editors

* Version 0.1
Pre-release version.
